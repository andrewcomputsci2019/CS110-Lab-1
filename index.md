## About Me
###  Back Ground
Hi my name is **Andrew** and I am a first year transfer student at *UCSD*, majoring in Computer Science. Before attending UCSD, I got my A.S in computer science at *MiraCosta College* between 2021 and 2023. San Diego has been the place I have called home for the last 14 years, and before that I have called  Florida and Japan home for some smaller amount of time.
### Interest
I have many interest inside and outside of computer science and hopeful this section will highlight some of them. Outside of computer science I have a large interest in **video games**, recently been playing a lot of helldivers, **photography**, and **coffee**. Within computer science a lot of my passion is found within **web technologies**, **theoretical algorithm analysis**, and **AI search and reasoning**.
